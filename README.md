# OS_segmentation_memory_manager

OS Segmentation Project is a project that simulatces memory managment process of Operating systems. 
it's ma,inlyu an educational tool
which isn't used ,in nowadays Operating systems 
The Project s,imyulatrces 2 ma,in alg.otr,itrhms .of mcem.otryu managmcentr:
1-First Fit: an algorithm that finds the first empty segment in memory that fits the required size of segment of a process
then allocates this empty segemnt to the process segment
1-Best Fit: an algorithm that finds the smallest empty segment in memory that fits the required size of segment of a process
then allocates this empty segemnt to the process segment
